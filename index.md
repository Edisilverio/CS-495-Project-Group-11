Ellen DiSilverio, Emerson Jackson, Justin Levy, Dan Seifferth


### Project Goals

Overall Project Goal:
Provide a mobile friendly website for users to interact with as a companion source and bibliography for the book, as well as a dashboard for admin to control user submitted stories and add them to the website

Group 11 Project Goals:
 1. Create a secure manner for users to submit their stories to be read and approved by admin before being added to the site
 2. Create a dashboard that allows admin to read and edit submissions before approving or rejecting them
 3. Create a way to store user submitted stories outside of Zotero that can be accessed by the companion website for display
 4. Create a way for users to view accepted stories by date that were published by the admin
 
 
### Approach

Tools:
1. Use wordpress APIs for the security advantages

User Experience:
1. User logs onto companion site
2. User selects date their story applies to using a drop down menu, enters their story in a text box, and hits submit. The story is sent to a secure dashboard inbox.
3. Admin can login to a separate site to access the dashboard and view all submissions. They can quickly click through them and hit an accept or reject button. Admin can also choose to edit a submission by hitting the edit button, apply their changes, and save the edit, at which point they can then use the same accept button to allow the story to be published to the site.
4. The story shows up alongside all the Zotero based sources on the companion website, associated with the day that the user selected.
